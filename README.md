# Rust AQI Fetcher

This is a simple Rust program that fetches the Air Quality Index (AQI) data for a given city using the OpenWeather API.

## Installation

Clone this repository: git clone git@github.com:nogibjj/week9_ds581.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd rust-aqi-fetcher
Build the project: cargo build --release

## Usage
To use the program, run the following command:
`
cargo run --release <city_name>
`

This will fetch the AQI data for London from the OpenWeather API and print it to the console.

## Configuration
The program requires an API key for the OpenWeather API. You can obtain a free API key by signing up for an account on the OpenWeather website.

Once you have an API key, put the key in the code and you will be able to fetch the AQI data
